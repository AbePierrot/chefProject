**To Donelys: **
***Feel free to add your work in this directory***
This project currently has an example of how the project will consume the REST API. It is a service I will refer to as `cache`.

Quick Notes:
- Changes here will be part of the whole project. You can also work on local repository, until you are ready. But here I can see it.
- We will link all separate components and then work on fixing flow after.
- Ask me for any data concerns/needs.
- To run this project, you will need to run the REST API through Spring, then `ng serve` the angularclient directory containing the frontend.
